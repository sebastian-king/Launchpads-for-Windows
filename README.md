# Launchpads-for-Windows


Unleashes the Novation Launchpad on Windows.

Allows the epic multi-colour display and 80-button pads be used to control virtually anything, just by plugging it into a PC.

The current program has an audio visualisation simulation for 2-channel audio, along with volume and program controls.

Written in C#.net, on VS 2013, and uses Midi-dot-net and InputSimulator libraries.

Known issues: handling USB-hotplugged is done in a brutish manner, needs to made more robust.
